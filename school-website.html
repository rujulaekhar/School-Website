    <h4>New School Canteen</h4>
    <img src="canteen.jpg" class="img responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">All the corridors of the school should lead to the canteen but unfortunately, it is in a corner of the school. It has a small window through which the canteen incharge supplies us snacks, tea and cold drink. Our principal has allowed a stall of ice cream in the canteen. There are two other counters for books, stationery and beverages. It is mostly the parents who visit the stationery counter. The students go there only under compulsion. Their most favourite spot is the ice cream corner. The students flock round it and buy the ice creams that are available in different flavours.Their mouths water at the sight of ice cream and they want to break the queue to have it first. The second favourite counter is that of beverages. They wash down their lunches with some cold drink or a cup of tea. They sip it slowly so that it could last for the whole period. As the bottle starts showing its bottom, their speed also decreases. They glup down the last drop with a heavy heart as if it was the end of their friendship with the bottle.The third counter, to attract a small crowd, is the place where the students get snacks. Toffees and chocolates are in great demand. Some students buy patties, bread-pakoras, slices or cakes. Some teachers also make a beeline for this counter. Everyone is in a hurry. There is a rule of “first come, first serve” but the students do not follow it. They always hand over money to the students who are nearer the counter and ask them to purchase the snacks for them.As the recess period is over, they leave their disneyland with a heavy heart. The students wend their way to the classrooms. One can see gloom writ large on their faces. They get ready to attend the last few periods. Canteen is indeed the most happening place of the school.</p>

  <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">How often have you been late to an important meeting or for that matter, have you always been in the habit of being late for most of your life? If this sounds familiar, then you definitely need to read on. Most of us have been late for school, late for classes in college, late for that date to the point where the date just walked out in a huff and the list goes on. The question that you need to ask yourself is why you would be late for an important meeting but the fact remains that something or the other always gets in the way. It is important that you attend these crucial meetings, be it school, interview, business meeting or for that matter, even your wedding on time. The early bird catches the worm and that’s a saying that most of us are familiar with but a bird that does not show up at all, always goes hungry. This is why it is important that you attend all the important meetings and on time so as to best utilize the opportunities that come your way. Check out some of the reasons why attendance is important, especially for young school kids.Value: Young kids are required to maintain good attendance all through until the time they graduate from high school. One of the reasons why children are required to attend to their classes daily is that it instills in them the basic value of attending all important meetings on time. More to the point, these young kids develop this habit early on and would always remember the importance of attending important meetings and on time. Whereas those who are homeschooled and in a less than formal environment are more likely to be late to key meetings than those who had attended regular school classes.
